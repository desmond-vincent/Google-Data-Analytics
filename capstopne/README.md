## 📘 About the Course

The **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** is an eight-course program that equips learners with essential data analytics skills. Topics include:

- Data cleaning and analysis  
- Data visualization  
- Tools like spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau

This repository documents my progress and includes code and reports for capstone and practice projects.

---

## 🧪 Projects

This repository contains:

- **Case Studies** – End-to-end analyses of real-world datasets (problem definition, data cleaning, EDA, visualization, recommendations).
- **Practice Exercises** – Skill-focused tasks (e.g., SQL queries, data wrangling, dashboards).
- **Capstone Project** – A comprehensive analysis applying the full data analysis process.

Each project folder includes a README with a summary, data sources, methodology, and key findings.
